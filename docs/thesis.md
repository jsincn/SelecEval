# Thesis

This project was completed as a thesis project at the  Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Systems at the Technical University of Munich.

As such there are two main branches included in this repository: 

- The branch ```thesis``` contains the code as it was during the execution of the experiments for the thesis
- The branch ```master``` contains the latest version of the code.

For reproducing the results from the thesis, please use the ```thesis``` branch. 
However, it may contain bugs and is not updated.

The configuration files used for the experiments are included in the [Examples Section](examples/paper/index.md).
